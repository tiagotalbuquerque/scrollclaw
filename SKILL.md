# ScrollClaw

AI-generated UGC videos that look like a real person pulled out their phone and started talking. Brands pay $500–$5,000 per UGC video from human creators. This pipeline produces them with a provider ladder: fal/Replicate for the original cheap path, or Higgsfield Plus credits for single-vendor image/video generation.

## The Pipeline

```
Brand name + URL
      ↓
/brand-setup → One-time brand research + file generation (Step 0)
      ↓
Brand + Audience
      ↓
/persona    → Persona research, creator profiles, approved script
/first-frame → Canonical face image (Nano Banana 2)
/animate    → A-roll talking head clips (Sora 2 i2v)
/b-roll     → Environment + product shots (Kling 3)
/assemble   → Stitch + unified voice + post-production + captions
/score      → Virality gate (70+ to publish)
      ↓
Scroll-stopping UGC video
```

**Core doctrine:** Read `_system/SKILL.md` for format selection, anti-patterns, taste calibration, and pipeline routing rules.

**Brand & campaign context:** Read `_system/references/brand-campaign-context.md` for workspace structure, context matrix, and persistence protocol.

## Routing

When the user invokes ScrollClaw or asks about UGC video, route to the right sub-skill based on where they are in the pipeline:

| User says / wants | Route to |
|-------------------|----------|
| "Set up a brand" / "Initialize brand" / "New brand" / "Brand research" | `/brand-setup` — one-time, before first campaign |
| "Make me a UGC video" / "Start a campaign" / "I need ugc" | `/persona` — start at the beginning |
| "Research this brand" / "Create a creator profile" / "Write a script" | `/persona` |
| "Generate the first frame" / "Make a face image" / "Nano Banana" | `/first-frame` |
| "Animate this" / "Make a talking head clip" / "Sora" / "A-roll" | `/animate` |
| "Generate B-roll" / "Product shot" / "Kling" | `/b-roll` |
| "Stitch the clips" / "Add captions" / "Post-production" / "Assemble" | `/assemble` |
| "Score this video" / "Is this ready to publish?" | `/score` |
| "Run the full pipeline" | Start at `/persona`, proceed sequentially |

Broad outcome requests stay at the root. Start the pipeline instead of asking the user to pick a sub-skill.

Stage-specific requests bypass the root and go straight to that sub-skill.

If the user isn't sure where they are, ask: **"Where are you in the pipeline?"** and show them the 6 steps above.

## Contract

### Input
- Required: brand/product context plus a campaign goal, or an existing campaign workspace if resuming
- Optional: format preference, creator profile, screen recordings/screenshots, existing clips, campaign slug
- Format: raw text, URL, file paths, or `workspace/campaigns/<slug>/` files
- Source: user prompt, campaign brief, and upstream `workspace/brand/` files

### Output
- Produces: either a route decision to the correct stage or a sequential full-pipeline run starting at `/persona`
- Format: inline orchestration plus saved workspace artifacts produced by sub-skills
- Default behavior: broad requests like "make me a UGC video" or "start a campaign" start at `/persona` and continue stage by stage until blocked by missing inputs, an approval gate, or a dependency failure
- Downstream use: `/persona`, `/first-frame`, `/animate`, `/b-roll`, `/assemble`, and `/score`

### Validation
- Pre-conditions: workspace exists or can be initialized before generation steps begin
- Post-conditions: the user knows the current stage, the next stage, and which workspace artifacts were produced
- Failure checks: do not leave the user at a vague route; if blocked, name the exact missing file, asset, or approval needed

## Quick Start

**First campaign:**
1. Set up brand context (one-time per brand):
   - **Recommended:** Run `/brand-setup` with your brand name + URL — it researches and generates all three brand files automatically
   - **Alternative:** Copy templates from `assets/` and fill in manually (see `assets/` for templates)
2. Initialize workspace:
   ```bash
   CAMPAIGN="my-campaign"
   mkdir -p workspace/campaigns/$CAMPAIGN/{creators,scripts,frames,clips,scores}
   cp assets/campaign-brief-template.md workspace/campaigns/$CAMPAIGN/brief.md
   touch workspace/campaigns/$CAMPAIGN/output-log.md
   touch workspace/campaigns/$CAMPAIGN/learnings.md
   ```
3. Fill in `workspace/campaigns/$CAMPAIGN/brief.md`
4. Run `/persona` → `/first-frame` → `/animate` → `/b-roll` → `/assemble` → `/score`

**Check setup first:**
```bash
bash scripts/check-deps.sh
```

## What ScrollClaw Needs

| Key | Required | Used by |
|-----|----------|---------|
| `FAL_KEY` | Yes for default path | Sora 2 (A-roll) + Kling 3 (B-roll) via fal.ai |
| `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` | Yes for default path | Nano Banana (first frames) via Replicate |
| Higgsfield CLI | Optional / recommended if using `--provider higgsfield` | First frames, A-roll, B-roll, Soul ID. Auth via `higgsfield auth login`, not env vars |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Recommended | Gemini (virality scoring) |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | Optional | Multi-clip voice consistency (S2S) |

## Higgsfield tiers

Use Higgsfield when you want one provider for first-frame + video generation. The API/CLI uses credits even on Plus; the web-app "unlimited" bucket is not exposed through the CLI.

```bash
export HIGGSFIELD_TIER=budget   # cheapest
export HIGGSFIELD_TIER=quality  # default
export HIGGSFIELD_TIER=premium  # best models, highest credit burn
```

| Tier | First frame | A-roll / B-roll |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `budget` | `flux_2` (1cr) | `kling3_0_turbo` (7.5cr) |
| `quality` | `nano_banana_2` (2cr) | `kling3_0` (10cr) |
| `premium` | `gpt_image_2` (7cr) | `veo3_1` (22cr; `--seconds` must be 4, 6, or 8) |

Overrides: use `--model <id>` for first-frame, or `HIGGSFIELD_MODEL=<id>` for video.

## Six Formats

| Format | Duration | Best for |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Talking Head | 15-25s | Product review, honest take |
| Hook Face + Demo | 15s max | App/tool demos |
| Podcast Clip | 8-20s | Authority, credibility |
| Wall of Text | 4-8s | Hot take, faceless |
| Visual Transformation | 10-25s | Before/after concept |
| Hybrid Transformation | 20-30s | Complex mechanism explanation |

## Key Findings (from testing)

- Sora's native voice > ElevenLabs TTS for talking head. TTS sounds fake.
- B-roll must be environment-matched. Extract a frame from A-roll → feed to Kling.
- Captions go LAST — after post-production. Grain degrades caption pills.
- AI cannot generate realistic app screens. Use real screenshots.
- ~1 in 3 Sora generations have hand artifacts. Reroll, don't fix the prompt.
- Multi-frame formats: chain from frame 1. Parallel generation causes face drift.
