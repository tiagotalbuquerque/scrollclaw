# ScrollClaw

AI-generated UGC videos that look like a real person pulled out their phone and started talking. Brands pay $500–$5,000 per UGC video from human creators. This pipeline produces them for $5–$50 in API costs.

## The Pipeline

```
Brand name + URL
      ↓
/brand-setup → One-time brand research + file generation (Step 0)
      ↓
Brand + Audience
      ↓
/persona    → Persona research, creator profiles, approved script
/first-frame → Canonical face image (Nano Banana 2)
/animate    → A-roll talking head clips (Sora 2 i2v)
/b-roll     → Environment + product shots (Kling 3)
/assemble   → Stitch + unified voice + post-production + captions
/score      → Virality gate (70+ to publish)
      ↓
Scroll-stopping UGC video
```

**Core doctrine:** Read `_system/SKILL.md` for format selection, anti-patterns, taste calibration, and pipeline routing rules.

**Brand & campaign context:** Read `_system/references/brand-campaign-context.md` for workspace structure, context matrix, and persistence protocol.

## Routing

When the user invokes ScrollClaw or asks about UGC video, route to the right sub-skill based on where they are in the pipeline:

| User says / wants | Route to |
|-------------------|----------|
| "Set up a brand" / "Initialize brand" / "New brand" / "Brand research" | `/brand-setup` — one-time, before first campaign |
| "Make me a UGC video" / "Start a campaign" / "I need ugc" | `/persona` — start at the beginning |
| "Research this brand" / "Create a creator profile" / "Write a script" | `/persona` |
| "Generate the first frame" / "Make a face image" / "Nano Banana" | `/first-frame` |
| "Animate this" / "Make a talking head clip" / "Sora" / "A-roll" | `/animate` |
| "Generate B-roll" / "Product shot" / "Kling" | `/b-roll` |
| "Stitch the clips" / "Add captions" / "Post-production" / "Assemble" | `/assemble` |
| "Score this video" / "Is this ready to publish?" | `/score` |
| "Run the full pipeline" | Start at `/persona`, proceed sequentially |

Broad outcome requests stay at the root. Start the pipeline instead of asking the user to pick a sub-skill.

Stage-specific requests bypass the root and go straight to that sub-skill.

If the user isn't sure where they are, ask: **"Where are you in the pipeline?"** and show them the 6 steps above.

## Contract

### Input
- Required: brand/product context plus a campaign goal, or an existing campaign workspace if resuming
- Optional: format preference, creator profile, screen recordings/screenshots, existing clips, campaign slug
- Format: raw text, URL, file paths, or `workspace/campaigns/<slug>/` files
- Source: user prompt, campaign brief, and upstream `workspace/brand/` files

### Output
- Produces: either a route decision to the correct stage or a sequential full-pipeline run starting at `/persona`
- Format: inline orchestration plus saved workspace artifacts produced by sub-skills
- Default behavior: broad requests like "make me a UGC video" or "start a campaign" start at `/persona` and continue stage by stage until blocked by missing inputs, an approval gate, or a dependency failure
- Downstream use: `/persona`, `/first-frame`, `/animate`, `/b-roll`, `/assemble`, and `/score`

### Validation
- Pre-conditions: workspace exists or can be initialized before generation steps begin
- Post-conditions: the user knows the current stage, the next stage, and which workspace artifacts were produced
- Failure checks: do not leave the user at a vague route; if blocked, name the exact missing file, asset, or approval needed

## Quick Start

**First campaign:**
1. Set up brand context (one-time per brand):
   - **Recommended:** Run `/brand-setup` with your brand name + URL — it researches and generates all three brand files automatically
   - **Alternative:** Copy templates from `assets/` and fill in manually (see `assets/` for templates)
2. Initialize workspace:
   ```bash
   CAMPAIGN="my-campaign"
   mkdir -p workspace/campaigns/$CAMPAIGN/{creators,scripts,frames,clips,scores}
   cp assets/campaign-brief-template.md workspace/campaigns/$CAMPAIGN/brief.md
   touch workspace/campaigns/$CAMPAIGN/output-log.md
   touch workspace/campaigns/$CAMPAIGN/learnings.md
   ```
3. Fill in `workspace/campaigns/$CAMPAIGN/brief.md`
4. Run `/persona` → `/first-frame` → `/animate` → `/b-roll` → `/assemble` → `/score`

**Check setup first:**
```bash
bash scripts/check-deps.sh
```

---

## Grok-only mode (no metered spend)

Every stage that calls a model has a Grok backend, so a campaign can run start to
finish on the xAI subscription — no fal.ai, Replicate, Gemini or OpenRouter key
involved, and nothing billed per generation:

```bash
grok login --device-auth                      # once; token refreshes itself

python3 scripts/generate-first-frame.py --provider grok \
    --prompt-file frame.txt --reference creators/reference.jpg --output-file frames/f1.png
bash scripts/generate-clip.sh --provider grok --image frames/f1.png \
    --prompt-file motion.txt --dialogue "the spoken line" --output clips/a-roll-01.mp4
bash scripts/generate-broll.sh --provider grok --image frames/f1.png \
    --prompt-file broll.txt --output clips/b-roll-01.mp4
python3 score/scripts/score-video.py --provider grok --model grok-4.5 \
    --video clips/final-01.mp4 --brief brief.md --output scores/score-01.json
```

Stitching, post-production and captions are local ffmpeg — they never cost anything.

Three things to know before committing a campaign to it. **No provider falls back**:
a Grok failure stops the run rather than quietly reappearing as metered spend on
another vendor. **Dialogue must be passed explicitly** with `--dialogue`, or the
creator mouths nothing and it reads as broken lip sync. And the `cost_in_usd_ticks`
in every response is **figurative on OAuth** — the metered equivalent, not a charge;
a 20-clip run logs dollars nobody is billed for.

What you give up versus fal: Sora 2's motion quality, and Kling for B-roll. What you
gain, besides the bill: A-roll and B-roll come from one engine, so they colour-match
without the cross-engine correction pass.

## Codex (ChatGPT plan) for stills

`generate-first-frame.py --provider codex` renders through GPT Image on the Codex
CLI's OAuth session — a second subscription-billed path, no API key. It exists for
one specific reason: **text inside the frame**. Grok writes crooked, invented words;
GPT Image renders Portuguese accents correctly. Hook cards, Wall of Text pieces and
anything with burned-in copy belong here.

```bash
codex login                      # once, in the operator's own terminal — OAuth, not automatable
python3 scripts/generate-first-frame.py --provider codex \
    --prompt-file card.txt --aspect-ratio 9:16 --output-file frames/hook-card.png
```

**Reference images work here too** — verified, via `referenced_image_paths`. A frame
built from the creator reference held the face, hair and glasses at 1024x1536, so
Codex is a genuine alternative for first frames, not only text cards. Pass
`--reference` exactly as with the grok provider.

The one hard limit: **Codex generates no video.** It is a coding agent and video is
not in its toolkit, so A-roll and B-roll stay on Grok or fal.

**Its sandbox is off by default here, and that is a deliberate trade.** Codex normally
runs tool calls inside its bundled bubblewrap, which on this host dies with
`bwrap: loopback: Failed RTM_NEWADDR: Operation not permitted` — and takes every file
read with it, including the reference image. Every sandbox mode goes through that
helper, so `--sandbox danger-full-access` is the only one that works, and the script
passes it unless you ask for `--sandboxed`. It means the model can run shell commands
unsandboxed: acceptable for a narrow image prompt on your own host, worth knowing
before it runs unattended.

## What ScrollClaw Needs

| Key | Required | Used by |
|-----|----------|---------|
| `FAL_KEY` | Yes | Sora 2 (A-roll) + Kling 3 (B-roll) |
| `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` | Yes | Nano Banana (first frames) |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Recommended | Gemini (virality scoring) |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | Optional | Multi-clip voice consistency (S2S) |

## Six Formats

| Format | Duration | Best for |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Talking Head | 15-25s | Product review, honest take |
| Hook Face + Demo | 15s max | App/tool demos |
| Podcast Clip | 8-20s | Authority, credibility |
| Wall of Text | 4-8s | Hot take, faceless |
| Visual Transformation | 10-25s | Before/after concept |
| Hybrid Transformation | 20-30s | Complex mechanism explanation |

---

## Key Findings (from testing)

- Sora's native voice > ElevenLabs TTS for talking head. TTS sounds fake.
- B-roll must be environment-matched. Extract a frame from A-roll → feed to Kling.
- Captions go LAST — after post-production. Grain degrades caption pills.
- AI cannot generate realistic app screens. Use real screenshots.
- ~1 in 3 Sora generations have hand artifacts. Reroll, don't fix the prompt.
- Multi-frame formats: chain from frame 1. Parallel generation causes face drift.
